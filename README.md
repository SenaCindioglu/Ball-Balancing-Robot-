A self-balancing robotic platform that maintains equilibrium on top of a ball using computer vision feedback and real-time control algorithms (PID). The system processes camera input to detect the ball's position and tilt, then applies corrective motor movements to stay upright while managing omnidirectional ball dynamics and inverse pendulum instability. Features a GUI interface that allows operators to define target waypoints and motion parameters, which are transmitted to an STM32 microcontroller via serial communication for autonomous navigation and execution. Real-time feedback visualization and system monitoring enable continuous stability adjustment and precise control of the balancing mechanism. <img width="1316" height="545" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ee31905-2cd7-4aab-b417-04bdf575b6cb" />
